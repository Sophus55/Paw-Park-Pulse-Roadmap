            <h1>Paw Park Pulse Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: </strong> December 26, 2025</p>

            <p><em>(Non‑legal summary)</em> You create an account, optionally add profile + dog info, and use location to find parks.  We log anonymous subscription attempt events (you can turn this off). We don't sell your data. If you delete your account, we delete your personal data and photos. There is no end‑to‑end encryption; standard platform security applies.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>Paw Park Pulse ("Paw Park Pulse", "we", "us", or "the App") helps dog owners discover dog parks, check in, and share community input. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.  By using the App you agree to this Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>You must not use the App if you disagree with this Policy.</strong></p>

            <h2>2.  Scope</h2>
            <p>This Policy applies to the Paw Park Pulse mobile application and any related in‑app features. It does not cover third‑party websites or services we do not control.</p>

            <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>We aim to collect the minimum necessary to operate the App. </p>

            <h3>3.1 Account & Authentication</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Email address (or Apple Sign In relay/identifier)</li>
                <li>Display name / username</li>
                <li>Internal authentication identifiers (stored by Firebase Auth)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 Profile (Optional Fields You Provide)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Profile photo</li>
                <li>Dog names, breed(s), basic notes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.3 Location Data (Permission Based)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Device location (approximate or precise depending on your device settings) used to:  show nearby parks, support check‑ins, and map features. </li>
                <li><strong>Location data is not sold and is not shared with advertisers.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.4 User-Generated Content (UGC)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Park photos you upload</li>
                <li>Park check‑ins</li>
                <li>Park change / improvement suggestions</li>
                <li>Other text or media you voluntarily submit</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.5 Subscription & Purchase Metadata</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Subscription tier (Single or Family)</li>
                <li>Renewal status, product identifiers, expiration date</li>
                <li>(No full payment card data—Apple handles billing. )</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.6 Support Communications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Emails or messages you send to our support address</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.7 Technical & Basic Operational Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Device OS/version, app version (used only to ensure compatibility)</li>
                <li>Error or crash context automatically provided by the operating system (if any)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.8 Minimal Operational Analytics (Anonymous / Opt-Out)</h3>
            <p>We log a very limited internal event when a user initiates a subscription attempt so we can understand paywall performance and reliability. </p>
            <p><strong>Event fields:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>action (e.g., "subscription_attempt")</li>
                <li>plan (single | family)</li>
                <li>source (UI context, e.g., paywall_cta, plan_change)</li>
                <li>timestamp</li>
                <li>user_id (UID or "anonymous" if not signed in at that moment)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No advertising identifiers, no precise location, and no payment card data are included. You can disable this logging at any time via <strong>Settings &gt; Account &gt; Anonymous Analytics</strong> toggle.  When disabled, no new events are written (existing historical events are not retroactively removed but can be deleted upon verified request, subject to legal limits).</p>

            <h3>Not Collected</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>No advertising identifiers are currently used.</li>
                <li>No third‑party marketing analytics SDKs (e.g., ad networks) are integrated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If this changes, we will update this Policy before enabling broader analytics. </p>

            <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p>We use data to:</p>

                <li>Process subscriptions and manage entitlements</li>

                <li>Understand subscription conversion (minimal anonymous analytics, opt-out available)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We <strong>do not sell</strong> your personal data. </p>
            <p>We share data only in these limited cases:</p>

                <li><strong>Firebase / Google Cloud: </strong> Backend infrastructure (authentication, database, storage). Google processes data per their <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy terms</a>.</li>

                <li><strong>Apple:</strong> Subscription billing is handled by Apple via the App Store. We do not see your payment details.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose data if required by law, court order, or to protect safety and rights.</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>

            <h3>Data Retention</h3>
